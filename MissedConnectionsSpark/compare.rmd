The purpose of HW03 is to compare the performance of different configurations we have learnt so far:  
1) Java Pseudo  
2) Spark Pseudo    
3) Java EMR  
4) Spark EMR  


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
require(ggplot2)
require(dplyr)

input <- 'timeOutput'
out <- 'timeOutput'

results <- dir(input, pattern=".csv", full.names=TRUE)
merged <- lapply(results , read.csv, header=FALSE)
result <- bind_rows(merged)
names(result) <- c("Language","Environment", "Minutes")

finalplot <- ggplot(data=result, aes(x=Language, y=Minutes,color=Environment,group=Environment)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size=2)

finalplot
```


# ANALYSIS:

For the java program on hadoop (pseudo), the time taken was around 2hours 45 minutes.
For the Spark implementation (pseudo), the time taken was 2 hours 25 minutes.
For the java program on (EMR), the time taken was 1 hour 3 minutes
For the Spark implementation (EMR), the time taken was 55 minutes

# CONCLUSION:

As seen by the report ‘Compare.pdf’, we see that time required for the Spark implementation on EMR was the least and for both, EMR and pseudo clusters, Spark implementation was faster
